## üöÄ Project

This repository contains a project that demonstrates the fundamentals of building a Web API using ASP.NET Core 6. It covers topics such as database connectivity using Entity Framework Core 6, working with services, dependency injection, configuration management, and API documentation.


## üíª Technologies

This project was developed with the following technologies:

- ASP.NET Core 6: It is a cross-platform, high-performance framework for building modern web applications and APIs. It provides a unified programming model for building web applications, making development easier and more efficient.

- Entity Framework Core 6: It is an object-relational mapping (ORM) framework that enables developers to work with databases using .NET objects. It simplifies data access and provides a convenient way to interact with databases, allowing for easy CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

- SwaggerSwagger: It is an open-source tool that simplifies API documentation and provides a user-friendly interface to explore and test APIs. It automatically generates API documentation based on the code and annotations, making it easier to understand and consume the API.

- AutoMapper: It is a convention-based object-to-object mapping library that simplifies the mapping process between different object models. It helps to reduce manual mapping code and improves productivity by automatically mapping properties based on naming conventions and configuration.

- Dependency Injection: ASP.NET Core provides a built-in dependency injection (DI) container that allows for loose coupling and improved testability. DI makes it easy to manage and inject dependencies into classes, promoting modular and maintainable code.

## üì• Setup

To run this project, follow the instructions below:
1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/brunocs90/AspNetCore6WebAPIFundamentals.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd AspNetCore6WebAPIFundamentals`
3. Install dependencies: `dotnet restore`
4. Update the database connection string in the `appsettings.json` file to match your database server.
5. Apply database migrations: `dotnet ef database update`
6. Start the application: `dotnet run`

## üìÅ Structure

The project is divided into different layers:

- **Controllers**: The Controllers folder contains the API controllers that define the endpoints and handle incoming requests.

- **DbContext**: The DbContext represents the database context and provides access to the underlying database. It is responsible for defining the entities and their relationships.

- **Entities**: The Entities folder includes the entity classes that represent the data structure of the application. These classes are used by the DbContext to map to database tables.

- **Migrations**: The Migrations folder contains the database migration files generated by Entity Framework Core. These files track changes to the database schema over time and allow for easy database updates.

- **Models**: The Models folder defines additional data models used by the API. These models are specific to the API's needs and may not directly correspond to database entities.

- **Profiles**: The Profiles folder includes AutoMapper profiles that handle the mapping between entities and models. It helps to simplify the process of data transformation.

- **Services**: The Services folder contains the business logic of the application. These services are responsible for retrieving and manipulating data, performing business operations, and interacting with the database.
